            <li> 1 satchel of fast action dry yeast</li>

            <li> 1 teaspoon of oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <p> Step 1</p><li> First, make the dough. Tip the flour into a bowl and add 300ml tepid water.
                 Mix together and set aside at room temperature for 1 hr. Dissolve the yeast in 2 tbsp water 
                 and mix this and 15g of salt through the dough. 
                 Cover with cling film and leave somewhere warm to double in size for a few hours. For a sourer flavour, 
                 leave in the fridge for at least 8 hrs and up to 24 hrs
                 the longer you leave it the sourer it will be.
            </li>
            <p> Step 2 </p>
            <li> Now make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the can and tip the rest into a bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt </li>
            
        </ol>
